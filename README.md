### My name is Allam Amzad and I'm a Junior at Caltech studying Computer Science.

🔭 I’m currently earning more about PyTorch and Deep Learning for a research project (starting in January) focusing on generative modeling using transport maps ([resource1](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume22/19-1028/19-1028.pdf), [resource2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09257)) and applications of Bayesian Inference ([resource1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05023), [resource2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06755)). 

📚 Tech Stack (in order of preference): Python, C++, C, Java, Javascript, SQL, MatLab. I'm also currently learning C#, and intend to learn more languages afterwards.

🤔 Math/CS Courses I'm currently taking in my Junior year (tentative): 
Fall 🍂: Probability Theory, Computer Systems, Information Theory   
Winter ❄️: Bayesian Statistics, Functional Programming, Relational Databases
Spring 🌱: Advanced Topics in ML, Statistical Learning, GPU Programming, Operating Systems

📫 You can reach me at allam.amzad1@gmail.com for any reason!

⚡ Fun fact: I'm a huge manga fan, especially of One Piece.
